  About Me
</h2>
<img src = ..\Assets..\Images\IMG_0796.JPG>
<p>
My name is Patton Parham and I have resided in Nashville for 8+ years now. 
I have my Bachelor's of Science in Audio Engineering from Belmont University. 
That is what prompted me to move to Nashville, TN in the first place. I work in 
this field along with running my own hand-crafted jewelry business under 
A1Obsidian. Having been out of school for three years with my Audio background,
I have recently made the decision to pursue computer coding with prospects of 
audio application development.
